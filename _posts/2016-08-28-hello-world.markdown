**Hello, World!**

In this blog, I am going to write about my personal experience with `computer science`, which may include topics like:

- programming languages;
- datastores;
- software design;
- software testing;
- agile methodologies;
- psychology;
- and a lot of cool stuff.

My primarily spoken language is portuguese, but I'm going to write all blog posts in english. The main reason for this is that I need to expand my vocabulary and get better at communicating.
